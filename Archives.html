        <p>Illuminated Prajnaparamita Sutra Folio
</p>
<h2>Estimated Date of Creation
</h2>
        <p>15th century CE
</p>
<h2>Estimated History of Creation</h2>
<p>This manuscript was created in Tibet or Nepal during the late medieval period, likely commissioned
by a royal or monastic patron. The text is written in gold ink on indigo-dyed paper, a luxurious
format reserved for sacred scriptures. The language is Classical Tibetan, preserving one of Mahayana
Buddhism’s most revered texts—the Prajnaparamita Sutra (Perfection of Wisdom).</p>
<h2>Details of the Manuscript</h2>
<p>The folio shows a seated <strong> Buddha Shakyamuni </strong> on the left and <strong>Goddess Prajnaparamita</strong> on the right,
richly adorned and surrounded by celestial figures. The central panel carries lines of sutra text in
elegant gold script. The deep blue background symbolizes purity and the infinite cosmos, while the
imagery elevates the manuscript as both scripture and sacred art.</p>

        <h2>Name of Manuscript
</h2>
        <p> Tibetan Illuminated Sutra Leaf
</p>
<h2>Estimated Date of Creation</h2>
<p>14th–15th century CE </p>
<h2>Estimated History of Creation</h2>
<p>This manuscript was likely created in a Tibetan monastic scriptorium, handwritten by monks trained
in calligraphy. It is composed in Classical Tibetan, and reflects the flourishing of Buddhist scholastic
and artistic traditions during the later diffusion of Buddhism in Tibet. Such manuscripts were often
commissioned by noble patrons or monasteries to preserve key sutras.
</p>
<h>Details of the Manuscript</h>
<p>The folio features a seated monk or lama figure painted in the left margin, framed by a halo and lotus
throne, symbolizing enlightenment and spiritual authority. The script contains neatly aligned verses,
possibly from a Prajnaparamita or tantric text, written in black ink with rubricated (red-highlighted)
sections. The combination of text and imagery shows its dual purpose—as scripture for recitation
and as a devotional object.</p>
